This tutorial shows you how build a simple Python application with CockroachDB and the [psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/) driver.

To get you started, we're installing the Python psycopg2 driver, installing CockroachDB, and then starting a single-node demo cluster.

Once you see a prompt like `root@127.0.0.1:38807/defaultdb>`, take note of the port number (the number following the colon). You will use it in your app's connection string later.

Then click **Continue**.
